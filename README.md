# Low Erosivity Waiver (LEW)
The Low Erosivity Waiver (LEW) or the Rainfall Erosivity Factor Calculator for Small Construction Sites app is a responsive, map-centric, mobile ready web application that allows end-users (i.e. construction companies, NPDES permitting authorities) to determine if they can waive NPDES permitting requirements for stormwater discharges from small construction sites. The waiver is possible if  

 - the construction site disturbs less than five acres, and
 - the rainfall erosivity factor (“R” in the revised universal soil loss
   equation, or RUSLE) value is less than five during the period of
   construction activity.

As such, LEW provides a web application and associated web service that allows an end-user to provide information about their construction activities to retrieve an “R” factor ranking to determine if a waiver is appropriate.
